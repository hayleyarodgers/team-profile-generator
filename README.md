## Description

My goal for this project was to create a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates a HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This allows the user to quickly access the emails and GitHub profiles of the people on their team.

To achieve this, I used Javascript. In particular, I used the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) package.

During this project, I consolidated my understanding of Javascript. In particular, I re-inforced what I have learnt about:
- Node.js
- npm
- Inquirer
- And, Test Driven Development.
